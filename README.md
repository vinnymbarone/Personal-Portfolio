# Personal-Portfolio
Personal Portfolio Project incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. 
Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. 
Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.

This portfolio will continue to be updated as I add new features and content to the page.
